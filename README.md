ðŸ‘‹ **Hi, I'm @manuelmariscal**

I'm currently pursuing a **Master's of Science in Applied Compute**, specializing in cloud computing and automation. I actively work with multi-cloud environments, leveraging technologies such as Terraform and AWS to streamline and automate cloud infrastructure.

I'm passionate about AI, particularly using and integrating Generative AI Agents (AGIs) into daily workflows to optimize processes and enhance productivity. Beyond coding professionally, I enjoy exploring and conducting independent research in my spare time.

Currently working as a Software Developer @ Oracle.
